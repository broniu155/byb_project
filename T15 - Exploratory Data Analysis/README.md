## Installation
To run the code for this task, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required libraries. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries, you can use the following commands:
```sh
pip install notebook
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

After installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```
Navigate to the task directory:
```sh
cd yourrepository/T15-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
```

## Usage

### Running Titanic.ipynb
To run the Titanic.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "Titanic.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform EDA on the Titanic dataset.

### Running Titanic-checkpoint.ipynb
To run the Titanic-checkpoint.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "Titanic-checkpoint.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and continue EDA on the Titanic dataset.

### Data Files

#### Titanic.csv
The Titanic.csv file contains the Titanic dataset. Here is a snippet of the file:

```sh
PassengerId,Survived,Pclass,Name,Sex,Age,SibSp,Parch,Ticket,Fare,Cabin,Embarked
1,0,3,Braund, Mr. Owen Harris,male,22,1,0,A/5 21171,7.25,,S
2,1,1,Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer),female,38,1,0,PC 17599,71.2833,C85,C
...
```

## Example Outputs
Here are some example outputs you can expect from running these notebooks:

### Titanic.ipynb:

    -Summary statistics
    -Visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots
    -Insights derived from the analysis

### Titanic-checkpoint.ipynb:

    -Additional visualizations and analysis
    -Further insights and conclusions
