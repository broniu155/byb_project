## Installation
To run the code for this task, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook, you can use the following command:
```sh
pip install notebook
```

After installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Navigate to the task directory:
```sh
cd yourrepository/T11-Datasets-and-DataFrames
```

## Usage

### Running Datasets Task.ipynb
To run the Datasets Task.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:
```sh
jupyter notebook "Datasets Task.ipynb"
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

### Running Report.ipynb
To run the Report.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "Report.ipynb"
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

### Data Files

#### balance.txt
The balance.txt file contains data related to financial balances. Here is a snippet of the file:
```sh
