# T17 - Simple Linear Regression & Machine Learning

## Description
This task involves performing simple and multiple linear regression analysis using Python. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This task uses various datasets to demonstrate the application of linear regression in different scenarios.

## Installation
To run the code for this task, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required libraries. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries, you can use the following commands:
```sh
pip install notebook
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

After installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Navigate to the task directory:
```sh
cd yourrepository/T17-Simple-Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning
```

## Usage

### Running simple_linear_regression.ipynb
To run the simple_linear_regression.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "simple_linear_regression.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform simple linear regression analysis.

### Running simple_and_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb
To run the simple_and_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "simple_and_multiple_linear_regression.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform both simple and multiple linear regression analysis.

### Running insurance_regression.ipynb
To run the insurance_regression.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "insurance_regression.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform linear regression analysis on the insurance dataset.
