# T22 - Image Processing

## Description
This task involves performing image processing using Python. Image processing is a method to perform operations on an image to enhance it or extract useful information. This task uses the MNIST dataset to demonstrate the application of image processing techniques in a practical scenario.

## Installation
To run the code for this task, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required libraries. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries, you can use the following commands:
```sh
pip install notebook
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras
```
After installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Navigate to the task directory:

```sh
cd yourrepository/T22-Image-Processing
```

## Usage

### Running MNIST.ipynb
To run the MNIST.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "MNIST.ipynb"
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform image processing on the MNIST dataset.

### Running MNIST_task.ipynb
To run the MNIST_task.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "MNIST_task.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform image processing on the MNIST dataset.

### Data Files
No separate data files are included in this task as the MNIST dataset is typically loaded directly from online repositories within the notebooks.

## Example Outputs
Here are some example outputs you can expect from running these notebooks:

### MNIST.ipynb and MNIST_task.ipynb:

    Visualizations of the MNIST digit images
    Image preprocessing steps such as normalization and reshaping
    Model training and evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss
    Predictions on test images and visualizations of the results
