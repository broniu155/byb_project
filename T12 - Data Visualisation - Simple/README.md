## Installation
To run the code for this task, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required libraries. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries, you can use the following commands:
```sh
pip install notebook
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
```

After installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Navigate to the task directory:

```sh
cd yourrepository/T12-Data-Visualisation-Simple
```

## Usage

### Running data_viz_task.ipynb

To run the data_viz_task.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "data_viz_task.ipynb"
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and generate visualizations.
