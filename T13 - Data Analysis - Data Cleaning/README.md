```
Navigate to the task directory:

```sh
cd yourrepository/T13-Data-Analysis-Data-Cleaning
```

## Usage

### Running store_income_task.ipynb
To run the store_income_task.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "store_income_task.ipynb"
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform data cleaning tasks.
