# T21 - Supervised Learning - Random Forests

## Description
This task involves applying the Random Forest algorithm to a dataset to perform classification. Random Forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. This task uses the Titanic dataset to demonstrate the application of Random Forests in a practical scenario.

## Installation
To run the code for this task, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required libraries. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries, you can use the following commands:
```sh
pip install notebook
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

After installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Navigate to the task directory:

``` sh
cd yourrepository/T21-Supervised-Learning-Random-Forests
```

## Usage

### Running Random_Forests.ipynb
To run the Random_Forests.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "Random_Forests.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform Random Forest analysis.

### Data Files

#### titanic.csv
The titanic.csv file contains the Titanic dataset. Here is a snippet of the file:

```sh
PassengerId,Survived,Pclass,Name,Sex,Age,SibSp,Parch,Ticket,Fare,Cabin,Embarked
1,0,3,Braund, Mr. Owen Harris,male,22,1,0,A/5 21171,7.25,,S
2,1,1,Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer),female,38,1,0,PC 17599,71.2833,C85,C
...
```

## Example Outputs
Here are some example outputs you can expect from running these notebooks:

### Random_Forests.ipynb:

    Summary statistics
    Forest model visualizations
    Model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
    Insights derived from the analysis
