# T23 - Unsupervised Learning - K-means Clustering

## Description
This task involves applying the K-means clustering algorithm to datasets to perform unsupervised learning. K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. This task uses various datasets to demonstrate the application of K-means clustering in practical scenarios.

## Installation
To run the code for this task, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the required libraries. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To install Jupyter Notebook and the required libraries, you can use the following commands:
```sh
pip install notebook
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

After installing Python and Jupyter Notebook, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Navigate to the task directory:

```sh
cd yourrepository/T23-Unsupervised-Learning-K-means-Clustering
```

## Usage

### Running Kmeans.ipynb
To run the Kmeans.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "Kmeans.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform K-means clustering on the datasets.

### Running Kmeans_task.ipynb
To run the Kmeans_task.ipynb notebook, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
jupyter notebook "Kmeans_task.ipynb"
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. You can then run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and perform K-means clustering on the datasets.

### Data Files

#### Country-data.csv
The Country-data.csv file contains data related to various countries. Here is a snippet of the file:
```sh
country,child_mort,gdp,inflation,life_expec,total_fer,gdpp
Afghanistan,90.2,553.0,9.44,56.2,5.82,1610.0
Albania,12.7,4090.0,2.04,76.3,1.65,9330.0
...
```

#### Mall_Customers.csv
The Mall_Customers.csv file contains data related to mall customers. Here is a snippet of the file:

```sh
CustomerID,Gender,Age,Annual Income (k$),Spending Score (1-100)
1,Male,19,15,39
2,Male,21,15,81
...
```

## Example Outputs
Here are some example outputs you can expect from running these notebooks:

### Kmeans.ipynb and Kmeans_task.ipynb:

    Scatter plots showing the clusters formed by K-means
    Summary statistics of the clusters
    Visualizations of the relationships between variables and the clusters
